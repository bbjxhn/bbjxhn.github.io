  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    Shrimp fried rice is a savory and aromatic dish featuring plump, juicy shrimp stir-fried with fragrant jasmine rice. The rice is seasoned with soy sauce and infused with garlic, ginger, and a hint of sesame oil for a rich, umami flavor. Mixed with vibrant vegetables like peas, carrots, and green onions, each spoonful delivers a satisfying blend of textures and tastes. A touch of scrambled egg adds a silky element, making the dish both hearty and comforting. Perfectly balanced, shrimp fried rice is a delightful combination of seafood freshness and classic stir-fry warmth.

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
    <li>Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.
